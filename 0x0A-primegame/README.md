# 0x0A. Prime Game
For this project, you will need to leverage your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

**Concepts Needed:**
<ul>
<li>Prime Numbers:</li>

Understanding what prime numbers are.
Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.
<li>Sieve of Eratosthenes:</li>

An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.
<li>Game Theory:</li>

Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.
<li>Dynamic Programming/Memoization:</li>

Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.
<li>Python Programming:</li>

Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.
</ul>
