**This function determines if all boxes can be opened.**

# **Parameters:**
boxes (list of lists): Each list represents a box and the integers within the list represent keys to other boxes.

# **Returns:**
bool: True if all boxes can be opened, False otherwise.

The function starts with the first box (boxes[0]) already unlocked. It collects all the keys in it and uses them to open other boxes. If a key corresponds to the number of a box, that box can be opened and its keys are added to the collection. The process is repeated until there are no more keys to use or all boxes have been opened.
